# jbashing

personal bash aliases and profiles with some versitility for the many many linux/bsd/osx machines I'm on.

    git clone https://github.com/Sector7B/jbashing.git ~/.jbashing
    echo "source ~/.jbashing/primer.sh" >> ~/.bashrc

## Commands
### jbupdate

### jbenable
symlinks something from available to enable (don't include .sh files, but it assumes there is one)
### jbinstall
installs external bash files to be sourced and symlinks them to enable folder.
